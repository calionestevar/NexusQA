AI tools removed from this repository

The following AI-related source files were removed from `LegacyEpic` and moved to your new repo `ai-castle`:

- `GoauldGatekeeper` (UObject + implementation)
- `NerdyAIGuard` (helper class)

If you still want to preserve history inside this repo, consider creating a branch before merging these changes. The canonical implementation now lives in your external `ai-castle` repository; update the URL below if you'd like this note to link to it.

Repository URL (replace this with your real repo): https://github.com/your-org/ai-castle

If you want me to open a PR that moves these files into a `ThirdParty/ai-castle/` folder instead (to preserve them locally), say so and I'll perform that move instead of deletion.
